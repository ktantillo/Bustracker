Discription 

This HTML and JavaScript file is ment to show the live bus stops between MIT and Harvard. The intent of this project was to show animation incorporation as well as fetch data from APIs and manipulate the DOM. This script uses aasync and/await functions. 

How to Run

Clone the files in the repo to your machine locally. Open the index.html file in the browser of your choice, Crome is recommended. Click the button that appears and watch the buses go along thier route. 

Roadmap for The Future

I would improve this with including more routes and displaying stop names.
